    /**
     * Enums, short for enumerations, are used in programming when we want to represent a group of named constants in our code.
     * Here are some scenarios when you might want to use an enum:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Representing a fixed set of constants: Enums are ideal when you have a variable that can only take one out of a small set of possible values.
     * For example, the days of the week, directions (North, South, East, West), and the suits in a deck of cards (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades) are all good candidates for enums.</li>
     * <li>Increasing code readability: Enums can make your code more readable and self-documenting.
     * Instead of using integers or strings to represent different types or states, you can use enums, which makes your code easier to read and understand.</li>
     * <li>Type safety: Enums provide compile-time type safety. If a method accepts an enum type, you canâ€™t pass in any other type, reducing the possibility of errors.</li>
     * <li>Using in switch statements: Enums can be used in switch statements, making your code cleaner and more manageable.</li>
     * <li>Adding behavior to values: In languages like Java, enums can have methods, allowing you to associate behavior with values.</li>
     * </ul>
     * Remember, the use of enums can vary based on the programming language. The above points are general guidelines and may not apply to all languages.
     * Always refer to the specific language documentation for the best practices related to enums. ðŸ˜Š
